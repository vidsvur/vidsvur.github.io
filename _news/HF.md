I was invited to present my updates on my work with the eastern hemlocks at [Harvard Forest](https://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/) for their Spring seminar series! Updates included metrics on our chromosome-scale eastern hemlock genome (16.5Gbp!!) and the introduced pest, the hemlock woolly adelgid! I also presented updates on our work comparing transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of putative susceptible and putative lingering (i.e, the "Bulletproof" Stand) individuals from samples taken monthly for a year! 
Thank you so much for the opportunity, to meet with researchers at Harvard Forest, and to see the hemlock woodlot area- where hemlock trees are studied from 10,000 years ago to the present was very inspiring! ðŸŒ²
