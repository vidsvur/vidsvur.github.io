I was invited to discuss my research progress on conserving the Eastern hemlock at the [Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University](https://arboretum.harvard.edu/) today! 

It marked my very first seminar talk, and I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to share it at my favorite arboretum :) I got to walk around and get a tour of the collections afterwards too. In all, a great start to my week!

The talk is at this [link](https://lnkd.in/gJkdA3pW).
