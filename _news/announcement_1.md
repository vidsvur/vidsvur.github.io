Our paper, "Immediate premeiotic transcriptomic effects following non-chemically induced whole genome duplication in the moss _Funaria hygrometrica_" has been accepted as a Letter to New Phytologist!!! This work highlights the changes in methylation, repeats, and gene expression after inducing whole genome duplication in a new system- _Funaria hygrometrica_.
